            <p>“A DECLARATION OF COMMITMENT IN REALIZING THE VISION OF SAN FRNCISCO HIGH SCHOOL AS A SHOW WINDOW OF EXCELLENCE”</p>  
            <p>Today, 18th day of July year 2005, in behalf of SFHS Student Body, we hereby declare the bright vision of our beloved school-- San Francisco High School as a show window of excellence.  As we gathered in this significant point of time, let us make a change, a change that will lead us to satisfaction, fulfillment and eventually to success.</p>            
            <p>In spite of the difficulties that we face today we still have a dream.</p>                     
            <p>It is a dream that is deeply rooted in the hearts of every SFHS student.</p>              
            <p>We have a dream that one day; San Francisco high School will have its true academic freedom.</p>            
            <p>We have a dream. We have a dream that one day the San Francisco educators will NOT be tired of developing the minds of their students, but their dedication to their work will not fade amidst the challenges of the time.</p>           
            <p>We have a dream. We dream that one day, San Francisco High School will be transformed into a paradise-like school that is gambling free, safe, environment-and child-friendly, where the acquisition of knowledge is conceivable.</p>
            <P>This is our hope, our faith and our dream!</p>             
            <p>With this, we will be able to attain our vision. With this, we will be able to transform and change our school. With this, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle and to stand up together, knowing that all of these would be possible.</p>
